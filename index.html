      <!-- Who are you? What are you interested in? What are you doing to learn to code? -->

          My name is Hasmik Varosyan. I am originally from Armenia, and I have been living in the U.S. since 2009.
          I was always interested in programming, but did not have a chance to learn it.
          I am now part of CoderGirl's Winter Cohort, a year-long tech training program
           of <a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a>.
          I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, Bootstrap and hope to pursue a career in Web Development soon.<br><br>
          Although I have a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, I am enjoying coding and in some ways
          my previous education is helping me throughout this process.<br><br>
          In my free time, I love to read and spend time with my family - my husband and 3 kids. We love hiking, swimming, playing boardgames,
          and watching movies together.<br><br>
