      <!-- Who are you? What are you interested in? What are you doing to learn to code? -->

      <p> My name is Hasmik Varosyan. I am originally from Armenia, and I have been living in the U.S. since 2009.<br>
          I was always interested in programming, but did not have a chance to learn it. <br>
          I am now part of CoderGirl's Winter Cohort, a year-long tech training program.
          I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
           and hope to pursue a career in Web Development soon.
          Although I have a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, I am enjoying coding and in some ways<br>
          my previous education is helping me throughout this process.<br>
          In my free time, I love to read and spend time with my family. We love hiking, swimming, playing boardgames,
          and watching movies together.<br>
      </p>
